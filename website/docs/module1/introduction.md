# Module 1: ROS 2 Middleware for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to Module 1 of our comprehensive guide on ROS 2 middleware for humanoid robotics. This module will provide you with a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts, Python integration, and URDF applications specifically tailored for humanoid robot development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

1. The fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its middleware components
2. How to develop Python-based ROS 2 nodes using rclpy
3. How to model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of XML (for URDF)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
- **Chapter 2**: Python Integration with rclpy
- **Chapter 3**: URDF Applications for Humanoid Robots

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 middleware for humanoid robotics applications.
